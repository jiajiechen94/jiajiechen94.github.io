    I am an Assistant Professor in the Department of Mathematics at the University of Chicago.
    Before joining UChicago, I was a Courant Instructor at New York University from 2022 to 2025.
    I received my Ph.D. in Applied & Computational Math at Caltech and my B.S. in Mathematics at Peking University.
    My research focuses on singularity formation in nonlinear PDEs, particularly those related to mathematical fluid mechanics.
